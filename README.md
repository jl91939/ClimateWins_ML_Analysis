# Project Brief: Machine Learning for ClimateWins.
## Introduction
In this project, I use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change while working as a data analyst at a European nonprofit organization.
___

## Key Questions and Objectives.
ClimateWins, a fictional European Nonprofit organization wishes to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. ClimateWins believes they can leverage machine learning algorithms to help classify and predict weather through historical data.

```
● How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data? 
● ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project? 
● Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
● Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

# Project Deliverables and Final Analysis Critera.

```
● Project folder follows industry standards in terms of structure and naming conventions.
● Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager.
● Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).
● All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
● Python scripts are clean and easy to follow with headings and contents lists.
● All code is consistent (e.g., with the use of quotation marks and spaces) and includes descriptive comments.
● Allrequired data sets have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
● Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking the top and the bottom of the dataframe.
● Whenever a dataframe is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its shape and basic statistics.
● All project data has been merged into a single data set. A frequency of the merge flag shows the merged data set is a 100% match to the combined original data sets.
● Merged data set only contains variables to be used in the analysis.
● All column names are self-explanatory.
● All identifier variables follow the industry standard data type.
● Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have been checked and addressed.
● Samples have been exported whenever an exclusions flag has been created.
● All subsamples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a consistent naming convention.
● Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.
● At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.
● Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to customer information.
● Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the questions in this brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.
● Final report contains data citation for Instacart and customer data sets.
