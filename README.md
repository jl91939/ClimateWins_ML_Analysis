# Project Brief: Machine Learning for ClimateWins.
## Introduction
In this project, I use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change while working as a data analyst at a European nonprofit organization.
___

## Key Questions and Objectives.
ClimateWins, a fictional European Nonprofit organization wishes to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. ClimateWins believes they can leverage machine learning algorithms to help classify and predict weather through historical data.

```
● How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data? 
● ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project? 
● Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
● Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

```
____

# Project Deliverables and Final Analysis Critera.

```
● Deliverables that directly contribute to the final product - in this case, a proposal for the best way to predict weather patterns and a proposal of a final algorithm to achieve ClimeWins' goal.
